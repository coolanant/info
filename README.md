## For Extra Points

1. Deployed on [Netlify - https://stoic-golick-1d5f6d.netlify.app/](https://stoic-golick-1d5f6d.netlify.app/)

## Future Scope

1. Add Redux - to improve state management & user data flows
2. Do Form Validation
3. And Improve Error Handling

### Redux Implemented on branch -`feat/redux` (On master branch we dont't have redux for simplicity)

If you are running the code for feat/redux, try adding this extension for development only - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en

- I've written login functions code on redux,
- We can implement errors and other things similarly
- and onRefresh as it goes, once we use our own JWT token, we can decode and manage redux seperately for that.

## Additional Comments

1. I'm currently doin an internship with `Indywise` where I'm working on there main project on frontend and there we are using the best practices only. Can't share all details but I'm very passionate, eager to learn and want to use best practices, but due to lack of time, I've made this only working

2. I have professional experience with Redux, Angular(few years back, will need revision) and many other things
