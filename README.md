## For Extra Points

1. Deployed on [Netlify - https://stoic-golick-1d5f6d.netlify.app/](https://stoic-golick-1d5f6d.netlify.app/)

## Future Scope

1. Do Form Validation
2. And Improve Error Handling
3. More code-splitting into api-handler (making all api's call there)
4. Redux

- I've written functions for google signin and facebook signin on redux,
- We can implement errors and other things similarly
- and onRefresh as it goes, once we use our own JWT token, we can decode and manage redux seperately for that.

## Additional Comments

1. I'm currently doin an internship with `Indywise` where I'm working on there main project on frontend and there we are using the best practices only. Can't share all details but I'm very passionate, eager to learn and want to use best practices, but due to lack of time, I've made this only working

2. I have professional experience with Redux, Angular(few years back, will need revision) and many other things
